# UCIDishesRating UCI Hackathon 2023
Django Based Web Application for UCI Dishes Rating.

## Inspiration
We all love Anteatery and Brandywine, our on-campus student cafeteria. As students, we are reliant on them for our daily meals. We observed that the dishes served did not suit everyone's palate. There are also very limited options for people with dietary restrictions. We wanted to create a platform for students to rate which UCI cafeteria served their favorite meals. This would also potentially incentivize the cafeteria to improve their food options and cater to the needs of students.

## What it does
We provide the UCI student body with a service that can help them decide which UCI cafeteria to dine at based on the menu for the day. Students can publish their reviews on the website as well to share their experiences.

## How we built it
- Django as backend
- SQLite Database
- HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap for the frontend
- nginx for the webserver
- AWS for the cloud server
- Used the Unsplash API

## Challenges we ran into
- For the backend, we encountered issues with server configurations and also the configuration between Django and nginx.
- For the frontend, we encountered a few issues like the layout of the website, and the design of it. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are proud that in this short time period, our team managed to create a website, through a server, that students can now use.

## What we learned
- We learned that we are much familiar with web application development,  and we also sharp our tech chains. More importantly, we learn how to collaborate with a group not only on coding together but also on communication skills with teammates.

## What's next for UCI Dishes Rating
- In the future, we would like to implement more functionalities with the website. For instance, a login page/system, and a likes/dislikes/comment feature.
